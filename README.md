# WINRAR Brute Force using C++

**For educational purposes and personal use only. I am not responsible for any loss or illegal activity.**

## Description

WINRAR brute force using C++ is a tool made using C++ with Code::Blocks. It has been tested 100 times and works on every software in my case. The tool can be used with either Command Prompt (cmd), Code::Blocks, or VS Code. It offers two options:

1. **Wordlist**
2. **Automatic**

If you have a wordlist, you can replace the existing file with it. However, do not change the name of the wordlist file; it should be named `wordlist.txt`. Similarly, the RAR file you want to use should be named `example.rar`. If you need to rename your RAR file, make sure to do so. If you are not familiar with C++, do not modify the code as it will not work. This tool is for educational purposes.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file and replace everything as mentioned above. Replace the wordlist and RAR file with the same names.
2. If you are using VS Code, open the terminal and type the following command (in bash type):

    ```bash
    g++ bruteforce.cpp -o bruteforce
    ```

3. This will create an executable file.
4. Run the program using:

    ```bash
    bruteforce.exe
    ```

5. Follow the given steps in the program.

## Requirements

- You should have WinRAR installed on your OS, or else it will not work.
- You should also have MinGW installed, or else it will not compile.

## Guidelines

- Please do not modify the code.
